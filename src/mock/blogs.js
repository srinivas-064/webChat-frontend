    content: `I broke my week into 90-minute sprints, then took 15-minute walks to reset. A few more tips that kept me afloat:\n\n1) Swap notes with a buddy *before* the night of the exam.\n2) Keep a 'question parking lot' so you don't derail yourself mid-revision.\n3) Sleep. Seriously, the extra hour was worth more than one more derivation.\n\nDrop your own hacks in the comments—might save someone else this semester.`,
